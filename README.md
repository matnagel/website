# website
A static website generator for my personal website. It converts files with a markup-like syntax to static html files. 
The markup syntax has been extended to allow more custom commands at the price of being more verbose; see the .mu files in the resources/marklight folder. 

In addition, this website generator also renders a json encoded bibliography, and automatically creates a menu for you.
